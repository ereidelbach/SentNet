# Project Overview

SentNet is an award winning tool crafted in response to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) Analytic Integrity and Standards (AIS) staff's [Xtend Challenge (Machine Evaluation of Analytic Products)](https://www.innocentive.com/ar/challenge/9934078).

Submissions to the challenge were judged against their ability to evaluate analytic products by meeting the following requirements:
* Properly describe the quality and credibility of underlying sources, data and methodologies.
* Properly express and explain uncertainties associated with major analytic judgments.
* Properly distinguish between underlying intelligence information and analysts' assumptions and judgments.
* Incorporate analysis of alternatives
* Demonstrate relavance to customers and address implications and opportunities.
* Use clear and logical argumentation.
* Explain change to or consistency of analytic judgments.
* Make sound judgments and assertions.
* Incorporate effective visual information where appopriate.

SentNet was created in partnership with [Taylor Corbett](https://github.com/data4d).
